# Recommendation-System
A machine learning model that recommends movies based on the preference of the user.

Recommendation systems are a collection of algorithms used to recommend items to users based on information taken from the user. These systems have become ubiquitous, and can be commonly seen in online stores, movies databases and job finders.

Content-Based or Item-Item recommendation systems. This technique attempts to figure out what a user's favourite aspects of an item is, and then recommends items that present those aspects. In our case, we're going to try to figure out the input's favorite genres from the movies and ratings given.
